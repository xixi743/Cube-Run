Following Brackyes' [*How to Make a Video Game*](https://youtu.be/j48LtUkZRjU) series on youtube, I created my first video game using Unity and my second video game ever (the first being the Space Invaders game we created in my Fundamentals of Computer Science class). This series of videos ended up to the creation of this game, *Cube Run*. The game consists of a player, a cube, that races forwards on a platform. In order to win, the player must avoid the obstacles that appear on the platform.
